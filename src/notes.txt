Change readByte functions to take the correct parameter
  * fix those functions that use readByte functions to include only what we
    need.  

NAK'ing on enable ----
  * Seemed to be something that resolved itself. Short delay is all that is
    needed. 
To do: 
  * Make sure functions that create an array, delete said array.
  * Make a specific write function for begin functions because they require longer
    delays to set up. 
  * Check to see if this function: SparkFun_Bio_Sensor_Hub::readWSP02Coef()
    needs to asign anything to the output of the read function. - Actually all
    long coefficient related functions....
