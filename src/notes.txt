Change readByte functions to take the correct parameter
  * numofRead does not have to be subtracted from to get teh StatusByte if
    your'e going to get it everytime. 
  * Incorrect - I have to request a certain number of reads, so I should add
    one in each read 
  * fix those functions that use readByte functions to include only what we
    need.  

These enable functions need to be changed to "suchAndSuchControl"
